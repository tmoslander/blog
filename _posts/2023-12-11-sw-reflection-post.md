# My SW Reflection

## Skills and Talents

The skills and talents most valuable in carrying out the social change work with Family Promise Pulaski County were professionalism, communication, and troubleshooting. Professionalism and communication were relatively easy to maintain consistently. I learned a lot more about troubleshooting and gained more experience with it, especially during the deployment process.

## Social, Environmental, and Spiritual Need

I feel that the approaches to creating social changes employed by Family Promise of Pulaski County are incredibly effective in creating change, especially with the new Diversion Program. I'm excited for the new Diversion Program to be able to assist people experiencing circumstances in which they may soon become homeless, so they can intervene and divert more people from having to go to a shelter. This will allow Family Promise of Pulaski County to help even more people.

## Fundamental Values, Social Ideals, and Significant Beliefs

My fundamental values, social ideals, and significant beliefs were largely confirmed through this project. I thoroughly believe that every person deserves to be housed, and that there should be no empty buildings until every person has a shelter. I believe that shelter and housing is a fundamental right of any human being, and one that should be addressed for every person. The experience of working with Family Promise of Pulaski County has only confirmed these beliefs. 

## Academic Coursework and Class Learning

Any of the academic coursework I found helpful largely came from working on the project, rather than working on the client. Working with the client was largely focused on professionalism, communication, and holding a sense of morality that aligned with the work of the clients we were engaging with. Professionalism and communication were skills I had developed not in any particular course but rather simply throughout my time spent at Hendrix thus far, and the latter was something I already held and has only grown from my liberal arts education experience. Academic coursework from both CSCI 340: Databases and Web Systems as well as previous CSCI courses I've taken were helpful throughout working on the project, especially the deployment process. I don't believe there's anything I've learned in class that I would now challenge after this experience.

## Reshaping Views on Public Issues

As mentioned earlier, this experience largely confirmed my beliefs. However, even though this experience didn't necessarily change or reshape my beliefs, working with Family Promise of Pulaski County allowed me to engage with those beliefs in a professional manner, and in a deeper and more meaningful way than I had so far. This experience has further sparked an interest I've had in computational humanities, and I'm excited to continue this kind of work further by taking CSCI 270: Computational Humanities next semester.
