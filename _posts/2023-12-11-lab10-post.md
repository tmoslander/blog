# I Made Three Separate App Services During the Course of Trying to Complete Lab 10 and Here's a Rundown of the Whole Process

It was quite a time. 

## The Easiest Parts of the Tutorial

Nothing.

## The Confusing Parts of the Tutorial

With my first app service, I fought a few random errors to finally get to Step 4 with the SSH terminal, only to find that my app service was Windows, and not Linux. Unfortunately, I would have to create an entirely new app service, as I wouldn't be able to switch from Windows to Linux on my current app service.

With my second app service, I was able to open the SSH terminal and cd to the right directory, but *./migrate* wasn't working. Upon running *ls*, I didn't have a migrations folder at all. I deleted the first app service and the Github workflow was successful, but I was still having a mysterious problem with *./migrate*. So, I started over again.

With my third app service (and a new forked repo) I was able to successfully run *./migrate* in the SSH terminal. Yay!

Overall, the Microsoft tutorial felt like it could have been a lot clearer and more helpful.
