# It's Finally Here: All of the Blog Posts I Forgot to Make Because I Always Forget About This Laptop!

Whew. That could be a *Fall Out Boy* song title. 

Anyways-this begins a long chain of last-minute blog posts because I forgot to make them because I always forget about this laptop. Speaking of-when I opened my Windows laptop to create these blog posts, my taskbar was gone and replaced with just a black strip. Our ongoing battle continues.

## Lab 6: My LucidChart Entity-Relationship Diagram

In my LucidChart ERD, there are three entities: the store owner, the items, and the customers. Items have five attributes: a name, a price, a description, the quantity available, and the manufacturer. 

The store owner can list items for sale.

The customers can register to create an account, select items to purchase, and create an order. A customer's account has a name, an address, and a phone number. A customer's items selected for purchase has a quantity desired, special instructions (if applicable), and whether or not that item can be substituted for another. A customer's order has a date and time, and is either pickup or delivery.

Other than not being able to figure out how to do crow's feet in LucidChart, I'm pretty satisfied with this data representation. 

## Lab 6: My Vertabelo SQL Schema

My Vertabelo SQL Schema is pretty much the same as my LucidChart ERD as far as entities, relationships, and attributes go. The only noticeable difference is that attributes have now been assigned types: strings, integers, etc. 

I'm the least satisfied with this data representation, mostly because I couldn't figure out how to connect actions to two entities, only one. The actions also just feel very empty and strange. I also couldn't figure out crow's feet in Vertabelo.
