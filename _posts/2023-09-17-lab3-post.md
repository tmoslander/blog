# The Path to Completing Labs is Filled with Hard Battles

I thought I had put my violent past behind me. I thought that, after defeating Ruby, I could relax. Put down my fists, let my guard down, and complete Lab 3 with no issues. Move on to a better life; a pacifist life. Bask in the glory of my past triumphs and victories with the knowledge that I was now a retired technology fighter.

Well...I was **wrong**.

So very, *very* wrong.

## What in the World Happened with Lab 3?

Honestly? It's a blur to me.

Remember in my last blog post where I said I had fought Ruby and won? I was pretty vague about how exactly I managed to get *blog* from GitHub. To be honest, I wasn't really sure what I was doing. But whatever it was, it felt wrong.

And *boy howdy* was my intuition right.

## The First blog-master

My first "fork" and "clone" of *blog* is actually a zip file, *blog-master.zip*, under my *Users* folder.

But wait-it gets **worse**!

Inside of *blog-master.zip* are two files: *blog-master* and *Ruby*.

Yeah. I don't really know how this happened.

## The Second blog-master

My second fork and clone is floating under my *C:* directory. Not even in my *Users* folder, much less under *my* user. Another mystery!

## The Third blog-master

My third fork and clone is actually under my user this time! And it's the only one that has a *.git* folder. I'm pretty sure this is the *blog-master* I had been editing while I was working on this lab before I realized something was terribly wrong.

## The Realization that I Could Not Retire

As I went through this lab, I made four commits:
1. Editing _config.yml
2. First blog posts!
3. Title and date switched and author tag
4. About me, Sun Conures, and CSCI 340 link!

For some reason, my first commit actually went through. But you can see in the picture below that the other three all failed.

And, of course, GitHub sent me emails saying my runs were failing. 

Something was wrong. Something was out there, calling my name. *Daring* me to step back into the ring of boxing technology. 

And I wouldn't be able to rest until I found it and **destroyed** it.

(Or get credit for Lab 3. That was something else I wouldn't be able to get. Pretty good incentive.)

## An Epic Fight Ensues!

Okay, maybe I purposely created a misleading header to keep you hooked and reading.

Was it actually all that epic? Probably not. It just involved me in the library late at night going through my File Explorer and realizing I had *a lot* of *blog-master*'s. 

(Also: they were called *blog-master* and not *blog*. Not really sure how that happened, either.)

Luckily, I was able to figure it out! I forked and cloned the *blog* repo-*properly this time*-and then copied over all the files from the third *blog-master* I had been working on so that way I didn't necessarily lose all my progress.

I had stopped right before [Step 3](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyllmods.html), so after I had copied over all of my changes from both [Lab 2](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyll.html) and the 2 previous steps, I edited the *style.scss* file to add my three changes. I also used [this](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) handy guide on what all HTML color names are supported by all browsers, and decided to go with this goldeny-brown theme. I'm actually not sure if I'm a huge fan of it, though, so maybe you'll open up this blog again later on and everything will be a totally different color. Who knows!

## Final Thoughts 

The truth is...I'm tired. Tired of constantly fighting technology: Windows Subsystem for Linux, Ruby, GitHub-it's getting to be too much for an old man like me. I need to retire, but I'm not sure this Windows machine will let me. It's truly a mystery to me. Sometimes I think about how I actually didn't have my Mac machine until last semester, and I wonder how I ever did any schoolwork on this thing. Also, now that I think about it, this Windows machine actually has Python super messed up. Apparently I have two separate installations of Python, and one of those is *specifically* only for Anaconda, which was an IDE I used in CSCI 280: Scientific Computing in Fall '22. 

Also, my Mac machine has, in my opinion, a super awesome background. That's another point for my Mac machine.

Look! They're all cats! At a cat cafe! They're so cute!

Long story short: Windows wants to box me at every occasion and Mac only slightly less so.
